## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Aggro Name Tags / Markers** | Red indicator on NPCs that will attack you. Orange when actively chasing you. You can completely hide these while retaining max hit data. |
| **Max Hit Display** | Shows each NPC's max hit, optionally coloured by attack style (melee/ranged/magic) or danger threshold (HP %). |
| **Aggression Radius** | Visualises the exact tile radius where an NPC will notice you. Supports True Tile and dynamic Line of Sight. |
| **Collision Prevention** | Tags physically bump into each other and float apart to prevent overlapping text. |
| **10-Minute Tolerance** | Automatically hides tags after you've been in an area long enough for NPCs to lose interest. |
| **God Wars Dungeon** | Full faction item detection — wearing the right god item suppresses that faction's tags. |
| **Slayer Integration** | Task-only aggressors (Kurasks, Wyverns, etc.) are only tagged when you're on their task. |
| **Slayer Warnings** | Shows missing slayer equipment icons with a red cancel sign on tagged slayer monsters. |
| **Disguise Detection** | Handles Ape Atoll Greegrees, Darkmeyer Vyre noble clothing, Mourner gear, Ethereum Bracelet, and more. |
| **Minigame Mode** | Automatically disables the plugin or reduces visual clutter inside instances like the Inferno, NMZ, Raids, and Colosseum. |
| **Single Combat Dimming** | Dims tags for NPCs that can't currently reach you when your combat slot is occupied. |
| **NPC Outline** | Draw a customizable outline around aggressive and targeting NPCs. |
| **Goading Potion** | Syncs with goading potion chat messages to automatically adjust your aggression radius. |

## How Aggression Is Determined

The plugin evaluates aggression in priority order:

1. **Active Combat** — NPCs actively interacting with you are always treated as aggressive
2. **Hard-coded passive IDs** — e.g. Lumbridge Goblins
3. **Disguises & Overrides** — e.g. wearing a Greegree, or being off-task for Slayer
4. **OSRS Wiki data** — per-NPC aggression flags sourced from `npc_data.json`
5. **Name-based heuristics** — fallback for NPCs absent from the dataset
6. **Standard 2× combat level rule** — NPC level × 2 ≥ your combat level
7. **Always-aggressive list** — Wilderness bosses, Revenants, GWD bosses/minions, etc. (exempt from the 2× rule)

### Known Limitations
- Aggression radius is hard-coded, and is not accurate for all NPCs. This is being frequently updated as NPC radii are found. If you find an NPC with an incorrect aggression radius, please submit a Github issue with the NPCs name and ID if you can!
- Quest-state aggression — some NPCs become hostile mid-quest and revert after. The plugin falls back to the 2× rule for these.

## Refreshing NPC Data

`npc_data.json` is built from the OSRS Wiki's Infobox Monster templates. To regenerate it after a game update (or as frequently as you would like), ensure you have Python locally installed, then run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python build_npc_data.py
```

This fetches the data from the Wiki API, parses it, and automatically writes the final output to `src/main/resources/com/aggrotag/npc_data.json`.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Tags not showing for an NPC | NPC may be passive by the 2× rule, or absent from the dataset. |
| Max hit shows `[?]` or nothing | That NPC's max hit is not in the dataset. Check the OSRS Wiki and consider regenerating `npc_data.json`. |
| Radius not showing | Check if "Disable Aggression Radius" is checked, or press the hotkey (default: Ctrl). |
| GWD, disguise, or slayer warning tags aren't working | Verify you have the correct faction, slayer item, or disguise equipped. Boss rooms ignore faction immunity by design. |
| Tags disappear after 10 minutes | This is correct behaviour — the 10-minute tolerance system is working. Disable it in Edge Cases if you don't want it. |
